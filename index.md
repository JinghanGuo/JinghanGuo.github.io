## About me

Currently, as a Master student majoring in Computer Science, I devote myself on programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and computer architectures, etc.
I used to work on the simulation of atmospheric physical processes with Fortran.
I am passionate in studying computer related techniques, such as high performance computing, big data management, machine learning, and applications development. I am also interested in Atmospheric Physics and Environmental Science and hope to do some correlation works with Computer Science. Aside of work, I enjoy traveling, reading, especially sports, such as swimming, volleyball, tennis, and squash.
