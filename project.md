### 1. Project in Signal Vine (2016.09 - present)
During my intern, I mainly work on two projects.

* The first project is an advanced enterprise message platform for higher education and nonprofits. In this project, I apply program definition language (similar with lisp) on the messages demanding by costumers. Specifically, I create a yaml file, import the messages to the sending queue, and send the messages to target students. Meanwhile, the messages are stored in the database (PostgreSQL).

* The second project creates internal utility tools on web servers.
I used Flask (a python framework) to create representational state transfer (REST) APIs.
They can be used to test file transfer between local and server, and  efficiently update messages.<br/>
This is a project I am really proud of. From knowing little about web server to creating useful utility tools step by step, I am confident to handle the challenges in future.

### 2. Course Projects in GWU (2015.09 - 2016.03)

* Socket programming: http web server. Create a socket, bind it to a specific address and port, send and receive a HTTP packet.  

* Implement distributed Distance Vector Routing: writing a distributed set of procedures that implement a distributed asynchronous distance vector routing for the network.

* Routing Emulation: emulate the functionalities of hosts and routers using BSD sockets for inter-process communication.  

* Implement an infinite precision arithmetic package for integer with more than 10 decimal digits. 

* Implement a memory management package for storing variable-length records in a large memory space, which uses worst fit rule for selecting which free block to use for a memory request. 

* Automatically generate a maze, then use depth-first search(DFS) and breadth-first search(BFS) to solve this maze, respectively. 

* Implement an address book supporting multiple field search in O(nlogn) time complexity, with the preprocess of sorting different fields before binary searching.

* Perform document analysis for text document with Go language, which fulfills histogram of characters, alphabetical list of the words, histogram of the words, and returns the top three word sequences in the file.

### 3. Weather Information Releasing System Management (2014.07 - 2015.6)

* Develop a new connection module to weather information releasing system and maintain the system.

### 4. Study of Cloud and Aerosol (2013.02 - 2013.11)

* Study the relationship between cloud height and aerosol's concentration in Beijing. Transform Laser radar data from time series to spatial

### 5. Simulation of Typhoon with Fortran (2012.05 - 2013.02)
* Design Fortran program simulation model about Typhon.
