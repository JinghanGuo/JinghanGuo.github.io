### 1. Project in Signal Vine (2016.09 - present)

## 2. Projects in Class (2015.09 - 2016.03)
* Implement an infinite precision arithmetic package for integer with more than 10 decimal digits. 

* Implement a memory management package for storing variable-length records in a large memory space, which uses worst fit rule for selecting which free block to use for a memory request. 

* Automatically generate a maze, then use depth-first search(DFS) and breadth-first search(BFS) to solve this maze, respectively. 

* Implement an address book supporting multiple field search in $O(n\log n)$ time complexity, with the preprocess of sorting different fields before binary searching.

* Perform document analysis for text document with Go language, which fulfills histogram of characters, alphabetical list of the words, histogram of the words, and returns the top three word sequences in the file.

# 2. Weather Information Releasing System Management (2014.07 - 2015.6)

* Develop a new module, which can be connected to the existed weather information releasing system.

* Maintain the existed weather information releasing system.

# 3. Study of Cloud and Aerosol (2013.02 - 2013.11)

* Study the relationship between cloud height and aerosol's concentration in Beijing.

* Transform Laser radar data from time series to spatial distribution by using data preprocessing skills, including cleaning and transforming.

# 4. Simulation of Typhoon with Fortran (2012.05 - 2013.02)
* Design Fortran program model simulating the Typhon with the classic numerical simulation algorithm and the complex boundary condition processing scheme, which could describe the
3D atmospheric motion under the impact of dynamic and thermal forces.
